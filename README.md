## About Perspective 
<p>
Curious about your crush’s perspective? Chat anonymously on Perspective with someone who shares your crush’s gender and sexuality! Whether you’re seeking advice or just want to yap about the situation 🤷‍♀️, this is your space. You can join as either a perspective giver or a getter. Who doesn’t love a little tea about someone else’s relationship before bed?
</p>

### Here's how it works:
- **1.** Choose to get a perspective (💡) or give a perspective (🍵👀).
- **2.** Match anonymously based on preferences like gender and sexuality, ensuring the advice feels relevant and personal.
- **3.** Start chatting, ask questions, and share insights—all in a safe space where your conversation disappears after the session.

### Who is it for?:
<p>
Perspective is for everyone. It’s a welcoming space for people of all genders and sexualities to give or receive advice, gain clarity, and understand relationships from new angles.

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
